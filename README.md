## Tech Test

The project is set in two directories, NodeJS & ReactApp.

simply run

### `npm install`

followed by.

### `npm start`

in both directories (order doesn't matter) and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in the browser.

Unfortunately didn't have enough time to unit/component test, or utilise JWT & use redux/mobx etc, and other things I would have liked to have done.
